This project intention is an attempt to create a C++ library for the ZigBee (http://www.zigbee.org/) XBee S2 Digi API for linux based machines.

Since this project started as a personal project, objects and support to certain functionalities will be added (given priority to) according the my personal needs but always taking into account the re-usage by someone else.

NOTE: The usage of this library requires the libftdi library (http://www.intra2net.com/en/developer/libftdi/) for USB/serial interface.
